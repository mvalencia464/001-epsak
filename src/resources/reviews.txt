Scott and his crew are awesome. Professional in every aspect. They completed a kitchen remodel, walk-in shower, flooring, and smaller jobs for a pending sale on our home. Thank you Scott, and thank you to your outstanding crew.

You have been a pleasure to serve Cheryl. I love chasing water leaks and working with you was a blast. You have a wonderful family and it was amazing to help with the custom tiled shower, drywall, paint, flooring, and complete kitchen remodel. So glad your home sold same day!!! Looking forward to hearing about your adventures and talking with you again.

Essential Property Services is among the best of the best! Scott helped us in a short notice situation and his team got to work immediately. They had the challenge of working around several tenants and did it with ease. Scott was also a fantastic communicator. He let us know daily what had been done, what would be done next, and kept us informed every step of the way. We will definitely work with this team again! 5* +

We felt comfortable working with Scott from the start; he just seemed smart and competent and responsive. He diagnosed and fixed moisture damage in our basement. His communication was excellent--especially appreciated since we were out of state. Highly recommend: honest and shows integrity with his work.

I recently had Scott come and work on some repairs that needed fixing. He went above and beyond for us! I had a leaky sink and a leaky bathtub and he fixed both easily. I also had him replace the faucet in the kitchen sink. I can’t recommend Scott enough. He is extremely kind and honest. I’ll be getting quotes from him from now on if I need any other repairs.

Absolutely the most ethical and honest General contractor I’ve met in Alaska. Our real estate team closes more than 150 transactions per year and there’s never a question on who to use for repairs. Choose him the first time instead of having him redo someone else’s work, I promise you, you won’t regret it.

You are an incredible agent MJ. You set your clients up for success through integrity and caring for the actual person...that's rare. I appreciate all the projects you send and really enjoy helping to find solutions to the challenges we face with our homes. We are happy to help change GFCI's, new lights all the way to full remodels of kitchens and bathrooms. Looking forward to working with you on the next one.

**5 Stars – Highly Recommended for Flood Renovations!**

After a devastating flood damaged my home, I was in desperate need of a reliable contractor who could bring my house back to life. Fun fact, insurance doesn’t cover ground water intrusion, even if it’s from rain, they will deny the insurance claim. I’m so glad I found Scott with Essential Property Services! From start to finish, the team was professional, timely, and thorough. They went above and beyond in every aspect of the renovation.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Exceptional Quality**: The craftsmanship was top-notch. Every detail, from the flooring to the finishing touches, was done with precision and care.
- **Efficient and Reliable**: They worked quickly without sacrificing quality, which was especially important given the urgency after the flood. I don’t know about you, but it’s hard to find a contractor that’ll even show up in Anchorage. Essential Home services is not only showed up. They got the job done in three days so my live in Nanny could arrive to a finished room.
- **Excellent Communication**: I was always kept in the loop with progress updates, and any questions I had were answered promptly.
- **Stress-Free Experience**: They took care of everything– making the entire process as seamless as possible.

If you’re looking for a contractor who can handle flood damage restoration and home renovations with expertise and care, I highly recommend Essential Property Services. I will call them again for any other repairs needing done to my house. They truly transformed my space, and I couldn’t be happier with the results. This is a team you can trust

The Essential crew worked on several projects in my condo throughout October 2024. Their team worked together to accomodate my hybrid work schedule - and did a great job! I am about to reach out to them to see if they can assist with some additional work :-) I highly recommend Essential Property Services.

Top Notch! Highly Consider hiring Scott for your next construction need! Here are 4 reasons why:
1.) Scott's high-caliber character is exemplified by being a man of his word and his decision/ability to stand behind that strong integrity for life.
2.) Scott has proven his unwavering care, attention to detail, and sincere desire for doing the job right the first time throughout multiple repairs.
3.) Scott has access to a legitimate and knowledgeable engineer and is not just shooting from the hip.
4.) Scott's honest transparency, solid dependability, and great reliability backs his craftsmanship far more than any written guarantee ever possibly could.

Scott and team were the absolute best to work with. I had a full remodel to do and they knocked it out of the park. Kitchen, bathrooms, lighting, plumbing, back deck, flooring, they do it all! I was always kept in the loop and they were always ready with suggestions and options! I love the finished project and would highly recommend!!

I have used Scott Cook on several projects now and APPRECIATE his responsiveness on our construction and remodel request(s). Scott also took care of a warranty item in a snap. I just referred a client this morning to Scott - he is that good.

Scott came and helped with the issue in my kitchen. He was able to schedule me quickly and came right away. I could tell he is an honest man, and he took care of the issue correctly. He spotted the problem and fixed it. I will definitely be calling him again if I have any issues with electrical devices (lights, switches, plugs, GFCI's) or plumbing issues with my sinks, faucets, or toilets.

Scott and Essential are a great choice for any of your contracting needs. I've had everything from very complex property reframes to home inspection lunch lists and he and his crew have done a great job with everything.

I appreciate having someone I can trust to get things done and not needing micro managing, and Essential provides that.

These guys did an awesome job with some flooring and trimming all over the house: both living rooms, bathrooms, all doors, kitchen, around stairs and stairwells. The house has some odd angles and round corners, and they took the extra time to cut the trim to make it look flush and seemless. They also cleaned up and didn't leave a mess everywhere, a problem I've had with other businesses. They even figured out an electrical issue in the kitchen. Would/will use them again on future projects.

Fast, polite, and professional! I had some work done at my doggie daycare and Scott was very quick and efficient with the work, along with being sure to try and be quiet as to not alert the dogs! I'll be calling soon for future projects!

Fantastic. I've known the owner / operator of this company for years, and he has never failed to live up to his word, and work. Being in real estate, I can safely say, in a decade, he's my favorite contractor. Whether you need a remodel on a kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms, or perhaps new flooring, lighting, exterior house work, tiling, windows, look no further.

Thanks for blessing us with the opportunity to remodel your residence. It was amazing to see the transformation with new flooring, texture and paint, new light fixtures, and a window. I’m also glad we removed that extra door in the entry as it really opened up the space. I hope it brings peace and enjoyment for years to come!

Thanks Scott. It was amazing how that additional bracing secured the deck. The interior cable rail looks great and it seems the heat is working great as it’s freezing this winter. Glad we figured out your shower leak and got that all sealed up for you guys. Looking forward to any other remodeling or repairs that come up in the future!
